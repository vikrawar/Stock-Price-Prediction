# Stock Price Prediction  

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using historical market data and machine learning techniques. 
It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and visualization of results.  

## Process  
- Loaded and explored historical stock data  
- Visualized price trends and key patterns using matplotlib  
- Engineered features like 50-day and 100-day moving averages  
- Carefully selected training targets (stock prices rather than derived indicators) to ensure meaningful predictions  
- Built and evaluated a linear regression model for forecasting  
- Visualized model predictions against actual stock prices for validation  

## Key Learnings  
- The importance of choosing the correct target variable â€” predicting the stock price directly rather than intermediate metrics like moving averages leads to more realistic and actionable forecasts  

## Libraries / Tech Stack  
- Python  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib
